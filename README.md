# Localisation-using-PSO
The particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is an optimization algorithm. It was developed by Eberhart and Kennedy (1995) and Kennedy and Eberhart (1995). The PSO algorithm replicated the social
behavior of animals found in nature. It particularly focuses on insects, herds, birds, and fish [1]. All of these
are particularly focused on searching for food. All the members learn and acquire search skills from other
members. PSO algorithm has been designed taking into consideration Artificial Intelligence and Evolutionary Algorithm [2]

Indoor Localisation using Particle Swarm Optimisation
Implementation of Indoor Localisation using Particle Swarm Optimisation which takes input as positions of the anchor nodes and distance between all the anchor nodes and target nodes and determines the position of the target nodes.

Results
With 4 anchor nodes and 1 target node (100 iterations, Population : 150 birds)
